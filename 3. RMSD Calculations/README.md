The following files were utilized to calculate RMSD values on a large number of GB1 variants against a single reference structure. 

1. RMSD.py is the main python script to run the job. The script takes two input parameters (input and output file folders, default to current folder) to run. It will search all "ranked_0.pdb" files in the input folder, and use the parent folder name as identifier. "ranked_0.pdb" files are generated by AlphaFold2 and represent the predicted structure with the lowest lDDT.

2. RMSD.sub is the HPC submission script which utilizes the Portable Batch System (PBS).
